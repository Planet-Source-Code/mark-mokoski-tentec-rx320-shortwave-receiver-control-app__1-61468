### Description

Control Program for the TenTec "Black Box" Shortwave Receiver. This App is not complete, but fuctional. A lightweight PC control app for the RX320, used mostly by me as a spare Ham Radio receiver. I have included in the ZIP the Ten-Tec RX320 Programmers manual and the service manual (PDF files) for reference in showing how the code module that talks to the radio works. I have no plans to extend or finish this at this time, so I send it out to the world here for anyone to play with. 73 de WA1ZEK / VK2IFH
